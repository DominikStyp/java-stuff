## File Names Changer 
<a href="https://github.com/DominikStyp/java-stuff/tree/master/FileNamesChanger"> File Names Changer </a> is a **Java program** written in **Java 7** build on Swing library, which allows you to change file names in selected directory,<br /> using defined **regular expressions**.

## Move to parent and change name
 <a href="https://github.com/DominikStyp/java-stuff/tree/master/moveToParentAndChangeToDirName">Move to parent and change name</a> is a **Java program** that **can be added to your context menu in Windows** in conjunction with batch script.<br />
It moves selected file to an upper directory (parent directory), and changes it's name to directory's name as follows: <br />
**C:/myDir/mySubDir/My-movie-with-cool-title/movie.mp4 ===> C:/myDir/mySubDir/My-movie-with-cool-title.mp4** <br />
It can be useful if you have **zip 7zip rar** archives with files packed like:<br />
**/myNiceNamedDirectory/1.jpg** and you wish to quickly move and rename files to more readable form using JUST ONE CLICK.
Whole instruction with **.reg** file is in project's directory, so installation shouldn't be a problem.
